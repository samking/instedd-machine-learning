trafficking,Six women rescued from prostitution,"Cambodian women trafficked to Thailand under the pretext of receiving legitimate jobs and later forced into prostitution were rescued last week in a raid on a karaoke parlour in Thailand’s Trat province.    Ly Sotheary, executive director of the Healthcare Centre for Children in Koh Kong province, said the six victims – including one minor – were being sheltered at the Ban Krettrakarn Girl’s Shelter in Nonthaburi province. She said the women were being cared for by employees of the Labour Rights Promotion Network, a Thailand-based organisation.    A seventh trafficking victim escaped the karaoke parlour last month, she said, and provided information that led to the raid, which took place on August 5. The raid resulted in the arrests of 21 people, including the victims, other Cambodian prostitutes, customers and two brothel owners.    Thai police eventually released everyone except a Thai man and a Cambodian woman, who owned and ran the karaoke parlour.     The pair have been remanded in custody while awaiting charges in Trat province, which is adjacent to Koh Kong province.    Ly Sotheary said the six Cambodian women would remain in Thailand to provide evidence in the case against the two brothel owners.    The women were “cheated”, she said, after they were promised jobs as maids or in garment factories, fisheries or restaurants.    She said that representatives from HCC would visit the six victims in the coming weeks and observe the trial if the suspects were charged.    Speaking under the condition of anonymity, a 30-year-old prostitute who worked at the karaoke bar in Trat province and returned to Cambodia last week said that she felt sorry for the victims, especially the underage girl.    “I was very embarrased when we were arrested, but I really pity the true victims,” she said.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Koy Kuong said that he was unaware of the case. Bun Leut, Koh Kong provincial governor, could not be reached for comment yesterday."
cholera,Six more ill in Kratie as tests made for cholera,"KRATIE provincial hospital has admitted six new patients suffering from severe vomiting and diarrhoea, its deputy director said Monday, as officials continue to await test results to determine whether cholera was responsible for the deaths of five people late last week."
cholera,Health officials comb afflicted Svay Rieng, "30 and 40 new cases of acute watery diarrhoea have been reported in Svay Rieng province, prompting health officials to go door-to-door administering treatment, the head of the provincial Health Department said yesterday.     Seven of the newly sick have been hospitalised, Pen Sina said.    The outbreak began just two days after a 9-year-old girl died of the disease.    Pen Sina said there had been “hundreds” of cases reported since late June.    He also said the department had received cholera test results from the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh, and that two of four samples from the end of June had come back positive, as had three of four samples from early July.     He added that this information would not likely be shared with villagers in Svay Rieng so as to avoid sowing panic.    “They tell the patients that it is just a simple disease,” he said of the health officials.     As of July 6, the Health Ministry had recorded 465 cases of cholera dating back to November 2009.     The cases have been spread across 18 provinces, according to a report available on the ministry’s website.     Pursat has also experienced a recent outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea, officials there said.    Sao Daroeung, the governor of Bakan district, said 47 people had been stricken with the disease on Friday. He said the cases had likely been caused by dirty water."  
aids,Holding back progress on HIV,"biannual International AIDS Conference began yesterday in Vienna, bringing together tens of thousands of HIV experts, activists and officials from around the world. The theme of this year’s conference is human rights – a recognition that only by protecting and advancing human rights can we effectively end HIV transmission and ensure access to AIDS treatment.  The Cambodian government has been praised as one of the world’s few HIV success stories for reducing the spread of HIV among adults. But while the global spotlight is on Vienna, Cambodia’s human rights abuses and inaction in stemming HIV among some of its most vulnerable, impoverished and voiceless citizens – such as sex workers and people who use drugs – is undermining that success.  Officially, the Cambodian government promotes human rights in its response to HIV. In practice, the picture is much different.  For example, according to the government’s strategic plan for HIV and drug use, HIV prevention efforts must “ensure that human rights are upheld.”  People who use drugs in Cambodia – particularly those who inject – are at heightened risk of HIV infection; at least one in four people who inject  drugs are estimated to be HIV-positive. However, instead of addressing either the issue of drug use or HIV with treatments that have been proved effective, the mainstay of the government’s strategy is police sweeps and detention.  Drug users interviewed by Human Rights Watch describe horrific abuses in detention for so-called “treatment”. Former detainees – including children – tell us that they have been shocked with electric batons, whipped with twisted electrical wire, regularly beaten, and chained standing in the sun. Some tell us of being raped by staff or coerced into donating their blood.  Sex workers arrested in arbitrary police sweeps and sent to so-called “rehabilitation” centres tell of equally horrific abuses. In a report to be released tomorrow, Human Rights Watch documents rape, beatings, and the ill treatment of sex workers by police during arrest and by guards at a centre near Phnom Penh, Prey Speu.  A female sex worker detained there told of a beating after she tried to escape: “Five guards beat me up. When I used my arms to shield my face and head from their blows, they beat my arms. The guard threatened to slit our throats if we tried to escape a second time, and said our bodies would be cremated there.”  Sex workers, drug users, homeless people, and street children are picked up in street sweeps and sent to these centres without any legal process. Our research found that when HIV-positive people are detained, they often have to stop taking their medicine. Interrupting treatment can cause HIV to develop resistance to treatment – endangering their lives or requiring costly second – or third-line therapies. We talked to one homeless, HIV-positive woman who was detained by Phnom Penh police last year. When she asked a police officer to return her confiscated HIV medicine, he replied: “You complain a lot! Jump into the truck!” She was subsequently detained – illegally – for days without medications at Prey Speu.  Ironically, the government has cited HIV prevention as one rationale for police roundups of sex workers, particularly before large public festivals in Phnom Penh. Prior to last year’s Water Festival, for example, the deputy governor of Daun Penh district justified the detention of sex workers by saying: “We don’t want to see the boat racers bringing disease such as HIV/AIDS back to their wives.”  The government – and, until recently, UN agencies – have claimed that people remain in Prey Speu voluntarily. However sex workers released just last month told Human Rights Watch how guards watched them at all times, beat and threatened those who tried to leave, and even “followed us to the toilet so we didn’t escape.”  Following a Human Rights Watch report released in January documenting abuses of drug users in government centres, some UN agencies spoke critically about drug detention centres, with WHO and UNAIDS joining Human Rights Watch in calling for them to be closed. From a public health point of view, this makes sense – in addition to being ineffective at treating drug dependency, detention centres can act as incubators of infectious diseases.  Protecting the rights of people living with and vulnerable to HIV is just one more reason why Cambodia needs to permanently close centres used to unlawfully detain sex workers, drug users and other vulnerable populations.   Instead government agencies should solicit input from the groups they claim to be serving to design community-based programmes – with peer educators and counselors to work with marginalised groups on a respectful, voluntary basis.  The slogan of the Vienna conference is “Rights Here, Right Now”, but if all that comes of the conference is rhetoric on human rights, an opportunity to end the AIDS epidemic will be lost. While the world celebrates attention to human rights and HIV in Vienna, concrete action is urgently needed in Cambodia."
