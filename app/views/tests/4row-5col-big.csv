Vong Saneath, a police officer from Khmounh commune, was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly opening fire on 47-year-old Long Hun and his family following an argument. Long Hun was killed at the scene, and his son, 17-year-old Long Lyheng, died on the way to Calmette Hospital. Long 
Hun’s wife, Uo Soy, 42, was wounded in the shooting spree, as were his nephew and brother-in-law.

District police chief Mak Hong said the accused had confessed to the crime, but that the shooting was in self-defence. 

He said the family had threatened him with an axe as he and his family drove on a motorbike past the victims’ house.

“The accused said he could’ve died if he was not wearing a helmet, because [the family] threw an axe at his head,” Mak Hong said. “He claimed they knocked his wife and son to the ground. Because he was angry, he said he took out his AK-47 and opened fire on them.”

Uo Soy denied that the family had threatened the police officer, and said the accused and his family had initiated an argument with her late husband.

She said they then beat her husband, and that her son-in-law, Yim Sovann, was hit in the head with a brick while trying to defend him. The accused and his family escaped, only for Vong Saneath to return later.

“About 30 minutes later, I heard a ‘bang bang’, and my son fell to the ground so I called for help,” she said. “I was shot as well, but luckily the bullet only hit me in the arm.”

She added that her nephew and son-in-law were both shot at “three times”.

Phnom Penh police chief Touch Naruth said that despite his claim of self-defence, Vong Saneath would be charged with premeditated murder. 

“Two people died and three more were seriously injured because of his shooting,” he said. “We will send him to court [today] for punishment.”"

The father of a 21-year-old woman who died during a training programme run by one of the firms said poor conditions had caused her sudden demise on Tuesday. 

Nhem Kimhouy, a Ministry of Labour official, said authorities found 24 of the underage girls during a Tuesday raid on a centre in Sen Sok district run by the VC Manpower Co. Seven other girls were found during a raid last week on a second company, the Champa Manpower Group, he said.

The director of VC Manpower told authorities he had no idea underage workers were employed by his firm, which is licensed to train and send Cambodians to work as domestic helps in Malaysia, Nhem Kimhuoy said. “He said he already checked their forms to make sure they were not underage,” Nhem Kimhuoy said.

Officials at both companies could not be reached yesterday. 

Under the 1995 sub-decree permitting the export of Cambodian labour, all prospective workers must be at least 18 years old.

Nhem Kimhuoy said the 31 girls had been sent to municipal anti-human trafficking police in Phnom Penh, and that authorities were trying to verify ages. Ministry officials ordered both firms to stop recruiting new workers until they can show conditions at their centres had improved, he said.

Last week, Russey Keo district officials accused Champa Manpower Group of illegally detaining some of the 232 women and girls found living in three of its villas. On Sunday, a woman who leaped from the second storey of a VC Manpower Co training centre said the company had refused to allow her to leave.

Yesterday, a Siem Reap man, Ream Vy, said that his 21-year-old daughter, Yun Mab, died on Tuesday while being held at the same facility. 
“I suspect that she died because she did not eat enough food and she stayed in a difficult place,” he said.

However, Keo Thea, director of the municipal anti-human trafficking and juvenile protection bureau, said the woman succumbed to an undiagnosed case of leukemia."

Chan Soveth, a senior monitor for Adhoc, said prison officials in Kampong Cham province had prevented his organisation from investigating the deaths of five inmates who died at Kampong Cham provincial prison in the space of just five days earlier this month. 

“We were barred from investigating the deaths at the prison, so I urge government officials and other relevant authorities to open a proper investigation,” Chan Soveth said. 

According to a report from Kampong Cham provincial prison Director Hou Puthvisal, five inmates at the facility died between July 7 and July 11; causes of death were listed as Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, high blood pressure, heart attack and respiratory failure. Hou Puthvisal declined to comment on the issue yesterday.

Chan Soveth said that officials throughout the prison system do not properly examine the bodies of deceased prisoners before cremation, and that they fail to investigate evidence that abuse and overcrowding have harmed inmates’ health. Kampong Cham provincial prison currently holds nearly 800 inmates, he noted, far beyond its official capacity of 500. 

New statistics issued this week by the Interior Ministry stated that 41 inmates nationwide had died during the first six months of this year.

Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak and prison department director Heng Hak could not be reached for comment yesterday.

http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010072240649/National-news/new-plan-for-civil-servant-salary-top-up.html,22-Jul,IRWIN LOY,New plan for civil servant salary top-up,"THE government has approved a revamped compensation scheme for civil servants, though observers say it remains unclear how quickly authorities and NGOs will be able to implement it. 

The Priority Operating Costs scheme was approved July 12 as a replacement for a previous salary supplement programme that was abruptly cancelled last year. 

Paul Pidou, deputy secretary general of the Council for Administrative Reform, confirmed that Prime Minister Hun Sen approved the sub-decree, which will be implemented retroactive to July 1. CAR officials were not available for comment yesterday.

A copy of the sub-decree obtained by the Post yesterday shows the new scheme will be more complex than the programme it is replacing. Under the POC scheme, development groups will be required to obtain permission to supplement civil servant salaries for each individual programme. 

The sub-decree also outlines two broad levels of pay scales: “national” and “sub-national/public service delivery” .

Jeroen Stol, country director for Handicap International Belgium, said the new definitions could help equalise payments offered by NGOs under the old scheme.

“In the past, different organisations paid different incentives for the same types of jobs, which caused ... jealousy in some cases,” he said.

However, many details are still unclear, he added, including the payment levels in which civil servants will be grouped.

Authorities will need to add a new management layer to administer the scheme, according to its implementation guidelines. Each POC scheme will require its own director and must be approved by the relevan ministry, the development partner, the CAR and the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

Sharon Wilkinson, country director for Care Cambodia, said her NGO still has not received any official word about the new scheme. “I still do not feel there’s sufficient information available for us to implement this within the timeframe designated,” she said. "
